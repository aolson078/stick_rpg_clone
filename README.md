This is a toy copy of the classic game Stick RPG.

Current features include a small city with several buildings. You can work, shop,
train at the gym, study at the library, and chat in the park. The player now has
strength, intelligence, and charisma stats that can be improved by visiting
these locations. The world runs on a 24-hour clock with automatic day changes.
Buildings keep regular hours and the city darkens at night.

A colorful gradient sky and detailed buildings give the city a cleaner look.
Buildings now cast subtle drop shadows for a little extra depth.
Soft white clouds drift across the sky to add more life to the background.
When the game launches you are greeted with a small start menu allowing you to
load a save or begin anew.

The city now includes a **Bank** where you can pick up a small delivery
side quest. Accept the job, bring the papers to the Library, and earn $50.

You can also deposit or withdraw cash at the bank. Any money left in the bank
earns 1% interest each day.

Jobs now offer promotions based on your stats. The office rewards
intelligence and charisma while dealing drugs in the park relies on strength
and charisma. A new clinic job values intelligence and strength. Higher stats
increase your job level and the pay you receive. The park offers a riskier
"drug dealer" job at night that pays more but depends on strength and
charisma.

A new bar sells $10 tokens that can be used to play blackjack or the slots.
Win games to earn extra tokens, or lose them if luck is not on your side.

The Bar is now a separate interior screen. Walk around inside to find the
counter for buying tokens, a blackjack table, slot machines, and a ring for
brawling. Move to the door and press **E** to leave.

There is also a brawler waiting for challengers. Combat now uses your
strength, defense, and speed along with any bonuses from equipped gear. The
fighter with the higher speed strikes first and damage is reduced by defense.
Win a brawl and you pocket some cash. Combat has been enhanced with a chance
to dodge incoming hits based on your speed. You also have a small chance each
turn to unleash a **power strike** that deals double damage and causes the
opponent to bleed for a few turns.
Two active abilities further spice up battles. Hit **Z** to ready a Heavy
Strike that deals extra damage in your next fight, or **X** to assume a
Guard Stance that halves incoming damage. Each ability has a short cooldown.

The shop now stocks a few useful items: a cola to restore a little energy, a
protein bar for health, a book that teaches you intelligence, a gym pass that
builds strength, and a charm pendant that boosts charisma. You can also buy a
skateboard that lets you move 50% faster while holding the **Shift** key.
Basic equipment pieces like a leather helmet, leather armor, and boots can be
purchased and equipped through the inventory screen. A wooden sword is also
available for the weapon slot. Each item lists its attack (A), defense (D) and
speed (S) bonuses.
Prices have been raised across the board and jobs pay a bit less, so it takes
time to afford the best gear and home upgrades.

Your apartment can also be improved. While inside the Home you can buy a Comfy
Bed, Decorations, or a Study Desk. These upgrades cost quite a bit but boost
your energy recovery and may grant daily bonuses when you sleep. You can also
craft furniture pieces and freely place them around the interior for purely
cosmetic flair. The Home is now a separate screen you can walk around inâ€”
approach the bed and press **E** to sleep, or step to the door and hit **E** to
leave.

Two larger homes can eventually be purchased: a small house and a luxurious
mansion. Each new residence unlocks additional upgrades like a Home Gym or
a Private Library, giving you more ways to build your stats.

As your stats reach new milestones you earn perk points. Press **P** to open the
Perk menu and spend these points to unlock or upgrade perks (up to level 3).
Available perks include Gym Rat, Book Worm, Social Butterfly, Night Owl, Lucky,
and Iron Will. Higher perk levels further improve their bonuses.

Winning fights in the bar now progresses through five increasingly tough
challengers. Defeat them all to earn the hidden **Bar Champion** perk. Owning
every home upgrade unlocks **Home Owner**, and maxing out all other perks grants
the secret **Perk Master** perk.

An achievement system tracks milestones like your first victory, amassing
$1000, and finishing the main quest line. Clearing the story records your
completion day and money in a local leaderboard shown on the title screen.

A shady **Alley** building lets you battle random enemies for cash and the
occasional token. Victories count toward quest progress and scale in difficulty
over time.

Outside the city gates lies a small **Woods** area. Three stationary foes wait
here, each tougher than the last. Approach an enemy and press **E** to engage
in battle for a cash reward.

The city also has a **Pet Shop** where you can adopt an animal companion.
Available pets include a dog, cat, parrot, llama, peacock, and rhino. Pets
grant small bonuses like extra defense or charisma and may help you find money
or tokens. Companions can be trained at the Pet Shop to improve these bonuses
and unlock stronger abilities.

A new **Workshop** lets you craft and upgrade gear. Fights and events can
yield metal, cloth, and herbs. Spend these resources to brew Health Potions,
forge stronger weapons, or enhance your armor.
You can also craft home decorations, brew Energy Potions, and forge a
powerful Flaming Sword using extra resources.

A small **Farm** south of town lets you grow crops. Buy seeds in the shop, plant
them at the farm, and harvest them three days later for extra cash.

The city map now stretches further east with three new areas. The **Suburbs**
contain friendly neighbors who sometimes need a hand, the bustling **Mall**
offers a short delivery side quest, and a sunny **Beach** lets you relax. Random
events at the beach may reward a valuable seashell.

The bar, park, and library each feature a simple minigame. Throw darts in the
bar to win extra tokens, fish at the park for cash or herbs, or solve a daily
puzzle at the library for a small money reward.

Weather now changes each day with rain or snow possible. The world cycles
through Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter, each lasting about a month.
Bad weather closes the park and deal spots, and special seasonal encounters
offer small bonuses or penalties.

Your apartment can also be improved. While inside the Home you can buy a Comfy
Bed, Decorations, or a Study Desk. These upgrades boost your energy recovery
and may grant daily bonuses when you sleep. Crafted furniture items can be
dragged to any open spot in the room for decoration.

As your stats reach new milestones you earn perk points. Press **P** to open the
Perk menu and spend these points to unlock or upgrade perks (up to level 3).
Available perks include Gym Rat, Book Worm, Social Butterfly, Night Owl, Lucky,
and Iron Will. Higher perk levels further improve their bonuses.

Winning fights in the bar now progresses through five increasingly tough
challengers. Defeat them all to earn the hidden **Bar Champion** perk. Owning
every home upgrade unlocks **Home Owner**, and maxing out all other perks grants
the secret **Perk Master** perk.


The game now features simple sound effects, looping background music, and
a smoother multi-frame walking animation for the player sprite.

A short quest line walks you through the basics: earning money, training, and
taking on thugs in the new Alley location. Press **L** at any time to open the
quest log and review your progress. The current quest also appears under the
stats bar.
An arrow above your character now points toward the next objective so you
always know where to go.

Random encounters can also happen while walking around. These short events may
reward or penalize you with money, stats, or health, adding some surprise to
each day. Certain encounters only appear at specific times such as early
morning joggers or late-night food stands.

After completing every main quest a mysterious **Tower** opens on the far east
side of the map. Inside waits the ultimate boss. Defeat this foe to earn a
huge cash prize and claim the powerful **Legendary Sword**.

A new set of ten trading cards can also be discovered at random. Keep exploring
to complete your collection!

You can save your progress with **F5** and load it back with **F9**. If a
`savegame.json` file exists, it will automatically be loaded when the game
starts. Press **F1** at any time for a quick reminder of the controls.
